<b><i>The Wolf Pack 5 ShowBiz Tape</b></i> was a showtape made for the first ShowBiz Pizza Place location in March of
1980.
The tape was used until the Wolf Pack 5 was replaced with the Rock-afire Explosion.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Summary </h2>
The Wolf Pack 5 ShowBiz Tape was based on the previous <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5">}}">Wolf Pack 5</a>
showtapes that had been seen during the 1978 and 1979 IAAPA Expos, though some modifications and additions were made.
Like the previous showtapes, a band from Baton Rouge, Louisiana by the name of Clutch provided the music for this
showtape.<sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup>
This showtape was broken into separate segments instead of playing as a complete show as its previous incarnations had.
The announcer from the previous showtapes would open and close the show before and after each segment. Additional lines
were recorded for him to accommodate the new segmented format. New songs were recorded to add more segments to the
showtape. The replacement of Queenie with Mini Mozzarella also garnered some changes to the pre-existing recording of
Dragstrip in the Sky. Since Mini Mozzarella received a new voice actor (Aaron Fechter), Dragstrip in the Sky was
re-recorded with his voice instead of Queenie’s original voice.<sup>(4)</sup> Additionally, a large portion of the
banter between the band members was scrapped.
The entirety of the Wolf Pack 5 ShowBiz Tape can be viewed and heard <a

<h2> Trivia </h2>
<ul>
    <li>The announcer in this tape refers to the restaurant as <i>'The</i> ShowBiz Pizza Place'. This phrasing was
        simplified to 'ShowBiz Pizza Place', or in some cases simply 'ShowBiz', in all future Rock-afire Explosion
        content.</li>
    <li>Good Times 5 Times (Reprise) was not re-recorded for this showtape, unlike Dragstrip in the Sky. As a result,
        Queenie's original voice and lines are still present in this song.</li>
    <li>After performing Dog Gone to Love, Dingo Star says, "On behalf of the band and meself, I hope we passed the
        audition." This is a reference to The Beatles' rooftop concert, where, at the end of the concert, John Lennon
        said a similar line, stating, 'I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we've
        passed the audition.'<sup>(5)</sup></li>
    <li>Wipe Out, according to Wolfman, is specifically dedicated to the announcer.</li>
    <li>'Dog Gone to Love' takes heavy inspiration from the real-life band, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles"> The Beatles</a>, and the various songs they wrote and
        performed. Some elements were directly lifted from various Beatles’ songs to be incorporated into one song.</li>
    <li>'Beach Bear Surfer Girl' takes heavy inspiration from the real-life band, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"> The Beach Boys</a>, and the various songs they wrote
        and performed. Like Dog Gone to Love, several elements were lifted from various Beach Boys’ songs and were
        incorporated into a single song.</li>
    <li>2 songs from this tape, 'Banana Hill' and 'Dragstrip in the Sky', would later be reused for the Rock-afire
        Explosion, where they were left unedited (aside from the Wolfman's dialogue being removed). Additionally, the
        intro music was reused for Rolfe DeWolfe's sketches.</li>
