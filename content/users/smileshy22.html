Hi, I'm smileshy22 (aka britishchick09 on social media)! I've known about CEC since my birthday in 2007, but didn't become a fan until July 2024. I love the Rock-afire, especially Mitzi and Rolfe. The '88 New Years showtape, Catch-a-Wave,  Mardi Gras City and Little Arrows are such bops! On the CEC side of things, I'm a fan of PTT (although Avenger is nostalgic!) and my favorites are Crusty, Doli, Sally, PTT Chuck and Rockstar Jasper/Pasqually. Hoping to go to Volo and Pineville someday! (and Goodyear, which is a much more achievable dream!) ;D
